# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other 
method before making a change. Once validated, feel free to create a Pull Request.

## Pull Request Process

1. Open an issue with the change you are willing to do. Ensure that I am aware and that the fix or feature is understood 
   and desired.
1. Create a fork of the `dev` branch and work over it. You can create a Work In Progress `[WIP]` pull request if
   desired or wait for everything to be complete to do it. That's up to you.
1. Once ready, ensure that you have not left any development dependency in, that your code passes the tests and that you
   have updated the docs if required. Create the pull request, if not yet created, and wait for review.
1. After reviewing the pull request, I am going to leave some comments left or to accept it. If valid, it is going to 
   get merged into the `dev` branch, waiting for proper testing and for a new release.
1. Be proud! You have contributed to an Open Source project. That's cool!
